# Character Identifier

A Python program that can identify handwritten characters A, B, C, and 1 via a manually implemented Computer Vision prototype.

## How to Run

The code can be run by simply double-clicking the file. Please note that only Windows users can run this program.

## Dependencies

The code installs its dependencies by checking the installed packages every time it runs, but in case of an error, here is the list:

1. [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
2. [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
3. [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)

## Algorithm

Algorithm has a total of 7 steps:

1. Alpha Channel Cleanup
2. Grayscale
3. Binarization
4. Labeling
5. Getting Coordinates
6. Identifying
7. Generating Output

The images of the test run is done with default values.

### Raw Demo Image

</p>

Note: The "Alpha Channel" text on the image is a transparency which is on alpha channel. The test run is done with default values which are 220 for the threshold and 8-Connected for the labeling type.

### 1. Alpha Channel Cleanup

If the image has alpha (transparency) channel, the algorithm paints the transparent pixels and deletes the channel.

</p>

### 2. Grayscale

The image is converted to grayscale in order to apply the binarization. The demo image is already in black and white, so the output is the same.

</p>

### 3. Binarizaiton

Each pixel of the image is binarized by the given threshold. If the value of the pixel is below the threshold, it is 0 which is represented by black. Otherwise, it is 1 which is represented by white.

</p>

### 4. Labeling

The pixels are checked if they are connected with each other. The connection method is given by the user under the "Labeling Type" option. If the method is 4-Connected, then only 4 neighbour pixels are checked for being connected, but if the method is 8-Connected, all the pixels around the current pixel are checked. The connected pixels are painted with the same color. (Credits: [@muhittingokmen](https://github.com/muhittingokmen))

</p>

### 5. Getting Coordinates

For each label, a loop, which runs 4 times, goes from the first row of the image to the last row to find the current label. If the loop finds the label in a row, it rotates the image and continues to the next iteration. After 4 iterations, the coordinates of corners for that label are found.

</p>

### 6. Identifying

A loop goes through all labels to cut the image in pieces, so that every piece is used for checking only one character. In each iteration, the cut piece is again enters to the labeling process, but this time, the binarized values are flipped. After the labelization process, the label count is used for identifying the character. If the count is 3, this means the character is B, and if it is 2, the character is A. Seperating C and 1 is more complicated because their label count is both 1. A special algorithm is implemented to seperate them. The success rate of this algorithm is approximately 90%.

</p>

### 7. Generating Output

After all the steps, the output is generated by drawing the boundries and writing the characters and labels onto the raw image. A process report is generated as well.

## GUI

<p align="center">
<img width="800" src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66966617/157082886-541c8204-e2c9-4754-a544-85a040c18003.png>
</p>

The GUI consists of these elements:

- Control Panel
- System Log
- Outputs
  - Image Preview
  - Report
  - Outputs Button

### Control Panel

The panel is simply gets the process parameters. The first parameter is image. The image can be selected via the "Browse" button. The other 2 parameters are "Threshold" and "Labeling Type" which are explained in the previous section. After selecting all parameters, "Start Process" button starts the operation if it is not started yet, but if it is, the button becomes "Abort Process" which aborts the process. Each process is run in its own thread.

### System Log

This part displays the status messages to the user. These messages passed through rerouted stdout and stderr. If there is an exception occured. The process aborts and the exception message is printed on the log as well.

### Outputs

This part contains all the output products.

#### Image Preview

On this part, every step of the process can be seen in realtime. After the process is done, the output image can be seen on the same element.

#### Report

The process report can be seen here after the process is finished.

#### Outputs Button

Each step of every process is temporarily saved to the "temp" folder of the user. This button is basically a quick access button to this folder. After the program terminates, saved processes are deleted.
